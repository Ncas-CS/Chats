This is the place where everyone shares their thoughts and talk to each other.

## How is this work?
If you are a member of this organization or just an outsider please feel free to ask talk,
GitHub's Issues tab is always open for you, just create a new issue based on the subject 
so others can reply to you.

## What is Issues?
Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. 
They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 
Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, 
and has its own section in every repository.
